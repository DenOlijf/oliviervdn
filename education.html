                From 2009 to 2015 Olivier studied at Sint-Jozefscollege Aalst and finished with science-mathematics. It was during this period he found his analytical mindset and felt like he should stay true to this. His enthusiasm for mathematics
                was beyond words and he decided to compete every year in the <span><a href="https://www.vwo.be/vwo/">VWO (Vlaamse Wiskunde Olympiade)</a></span>, always passing to further rounds. He really couldn't let go of unsolved problems.

                At Ghent University the freshman opted to go for engineering, purely to develop his mathematical and problem solving mindset further.
                After one year of very hard work Olivier got an opportunity to go for computer science or physics in his remaining years. Being introduced to Java programming but still having feelings for one of his older courses,
                Olivier chose for the new and challenging option. In a period of 5 years he went from the very worst IT student in his high-school classroom to a CS engineer cum laude.

            In his final Master year from 2019 to 2020, Olivier could choose from over 400 options for his dissertation. He recently leard about Machine and Deep Learning and felt like a big project like a thesis could be the perfect opportunity to
            dig deeper into these concepts. Olivier chose to build a medical solution with respect to diagnosing skin cancer and explaining why the system classifies specific skin images into different cancer types.
